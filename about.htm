  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>
    This web application demonstrates a minimalist integration of Stable Diffusion image generation into a static HTML page, using the Pollinations.ai public API.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Only plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript are used—no frameworks, no back-end server.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> No API keys or authentication steps are required. Anyone with a modern browser and internet access can generate images by typing a prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All source code is released under the MIT License, and the external Pollinations.ai API is acknowledged without bundling or redistributing its code.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> By stripping away all non-essential layers, this demo helps learners understand how client-side fetch calls can drive real-time AI services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Whether you’re exploring generative AI for the first time or building a quick prototype for class, this project shows how a few lines of code can unlock powerful image synthesis—all in a single HTML file.
